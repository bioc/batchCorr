\value{
a SummarizedExperiment object as PeakTabFill with the the aligned 
matrix or a list of six:
\itemize{
  \item PTalign: the aligned peak table
  \item boolAveragedAlign: boolean vector of final features where alignment 
    has been made using feature averaging
  \item PTfill: peaktable without missing values (indata)
  \item boolKeep: boolean vector of features kept after alignment
  \item boolAveragedFill boolean vector of original features where alignment 
    has been made using feature averaging
  \item aI: alignIndex object (indata)
}
}
\description{
Multi-batch alignment of features artificially split between batches.
}
\details{
A basic method with matrices (samples as rows) and SummarizedExperiment is 
supported. For grouping variables such as batches, the basic method expects 
vectors, while the SummarizedExperiment method expects the names of the 
respective columns in PeakTabFilled. The basic method returns a list with 
the aligned peak table and information about the process, whereas the 
SummarizedExperiment method assigns the aligned peak table to the object 
supplied to PeakTabFilled.

# Basic method
## Extract peakinfo (i.e. m/z and rt of features).
peakIn <- peakInfo(PT = PTnofill, sep = "@", start = 3)
## Perform multi-batch alignment
alignBat <- alignBatches(
    peakInfo = peakIn, PeakTabNoFill = PTnofill,
    PeakTabFilled = PTfill, batches = meta$batch,
    sampleGroups = meta$grp, selectGroup = "QC",
    reportPath = "drift_report/"
)
## Extract new peak table
PT <- alignBat$PTalign

# SummarizedExperiment
## Construct SummarizedExperiment
peaks <- SimpleList(t(PTnofill), t(PTfill))
