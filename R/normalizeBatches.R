#' Between-batch normalisation
#'
#' Batches are feature-wise normalised by Ref samples if passing heuristic 
#' criteria (CV and fold change). Otherwise normalized by population median.
#'
#' A basic method for matrix (samples as rows) and SummarizedExperiment is 
#' supported. For grouping variables such as sampleGroup, the basic method 
#' expects vectors, while the SummarizedExperiment method expects the names of 
#' the respective columns. The basic method returns a list with the normalized 
#' peak table and information about the process, whereas the 
#' SummarizedExperiment method assigns the normalized peak table to the object 
#' supplied.

#' @param peakTableCorr SummarizedExperiment object or matrix
#' @param batches character scalar or factor, batch labels
#' @param sampleGroup character scalar or character, group labels
#' @param refGroup character scalar, identifier of reference samples
#' (default = "QC")
#' @param population character scalar, identifier of population samples in 
#' sampleGroups (default: "all")
#' @param CVlimit  numeric scalar, coefficient of variance threshold for 
#' filtering each batch by reference samples (default: 0.3)
#' @param FCLimit numeric scalar, fold-change between average intensity in 
#' batches threshold (default: 5)
#' @param medianZero character scalar, strategy for substituting median value 
#' for population normalization when median is zero (-> Inf). Either 'mean' or 
#' 'min' (default: "min, i.e. lowest non-zero value)
#' @param assay.type character scalar, assay to be used in case of multiple
#' assays
